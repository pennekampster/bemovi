Title: BEMOVI, software for extracting BEhaviour and MOrphology from VIdeos
Description: An R and ImageJ based work flow to automatically measure behaviour
    and morphology from videos. Moving individuals are identified by background subtraction, 
    morphology extracted, and trajectories assembled through time from coordinate data. 
    Abundance, morphology and behaviour can be summarized based on trajectory data.
