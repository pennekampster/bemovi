Bemovi, software for extracting BEhaviour and MOrphology from VIdeos.
=============================================================================

This version of BEMOVI (eaf_dev; Emanuel A. Fronhofer, April 2016) is based on the originally published master branch. It includes a new function called "summarize_populations()" that generates a table with population (sample) level summaries of movement and morphology as well as an estimate of the population density.
