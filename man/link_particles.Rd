\title{Function to link the particle coordinates through time}
\usage{
link_particles(to.data, particle.data.folder, trajectory.data.folder,
  linkrange = 1, disp = 10, start_vid = 1, memory = 512,
  to.particlelinker, pixel_to_scale, fps)
}
\arguments{
\item{to.data}{path to the working directory}

\item{particle.data.folder}{directory where the ParticleAnalyzer output is saved (as text files) (temporary)}

\item{trajectory.data.folder}{directory where the ParticleLinker is saved (as text files) (temporary???)}

\item{linkrange}{numeric value passed to the ParticleLinker specifying the range of adjacent frames which
are taken into account when a trajectory is re-constructed}

\item{disp}{numeric value that specifies the maximum displacement of a given particle between two frames}

\item{start_vid}{numeric value to indicate whether the linking should be started with a video other than the first}

\item{memory}{numeric value specifying the max amount of memory allocated to the ParticleLinker (defaults to 512)}

\item{to.particlelinker}{path to ParticleLinker jar file}

\item{pixel_to_scale}{TODO}

\item{fps}{Frames Per Second of the video}
}
\value{
Returns a single text file per video containing the X- and Y-coordinates, the frame and a trajectory ID. The files are than automatically merged into a data.table
with the movement metrics for each fix appended to the original data (NB: movement metrics often need two (e.g. step length), sometimes even 
three (e.g., turning angles) fixes; fixes for which metrics cannot be calculated are padded with NA). The movement parameters are the step length, the step duration, 
the step speed (step length/step duration), the gross displacement as the cumulative sum of the step lengths, the net displacement between the first fix of a given trajectory 
and the current fix and finally the relative angle (turning angle) and absolute angle (in radians). For details on these metrics, please refer to a dedicated textbook 
(e.g. Turch (1998): Quantitative Analysis of Movement: Measuring and Modeling Population Redistribution in Animals and Plants, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland).
}
\description{
The function takes the XY-coordinates provided by the ImageJ ParticleAnalyzer and uses a standalone version of the ImageJ MOSAIC plugin ParticleLinker to create trajectories. 
This requires some creation of temporary files, which are subsequently deleted.
