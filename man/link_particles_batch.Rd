\title{Modified function to link the particle coordinates through time, working on temporal chunks (e.g. 20 frames) of
the original video. An overlap needs to be provided to allow stitching the short trajectories in each chunk 
into trajectories spanning the whole video.}
\usage{
link_particles_batch(
  to.data,
  particle.data.folder,
  trajectory.data.folder,
  linkrange = 1,
  disp = 10,
  start_vid = 1,
  memory = 512,
  batch_size = 25,
  overlap = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{to.data}{path to the working directory}

\item{particle.data.folder}{directory where the ParticleAnalyzer output is saved (as text files) (temporary)}

\item{trajectory.data.folder}{directory where the ParticleLinker is saved (as text files) (temporary???)}

\item{linkrange}{numeric value passed to the ParticleLinker specifying the range of adjacent frames which
are taken into account when a trajectory is re-constructed}

\item{disp}{numeric value that specifies the maximum displacement of a given particle between two frames}

\item{start_vid}{numeric value to indicate whether the linking should be started with a video other than the first}

\item{memory}{numeric value specifying the max amount of memory allocated to the ParticleLinker (defaults to 512)}

\item{batch_size}{size of the chunk in frames}

\item{overlap}{in frames between chunks}
}
\value{
Returns a single text file per video containing the X- and Y-coordinates, the frame and a trajectory ID
}
\description{
The function takes the XY-coordinates provided by the ImageJ ParticleAnalyzer and uses a standalone version of the ImageJ MOSAIC plugin ParticleLinker to create trajectories. 
This requires some creation of temporary files, which are subsequently deleted.
